                <h1>Product Introduction</h1>
            <br>
        <p>This product was inspired and designed not only for myself, but for others to take control of their health. Also to inspire not just physical health, but mental and spiritual health too! I believe it is important to have a healthy mind, body, and soul. Self love is the best love that you could ever give to yourself so why not become a better you? Trust God during the process, embrace the skin that you're in flaws and all!!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Remember that you can do all things through Christ who give you strength. -Philippians 4:13</p>
